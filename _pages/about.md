About me
======

I am a General Engineering and Applied Mathematics Double-Major at Swarthmore College with experience in electrical and mechanical engineering, computational fluid dynamics, and numerical methods. I am from Portland, Oregon, and when I am not studying or working on personal projects, I enjoy backpacking, playing soccer, skiing, reading, practicing Spanish, and playing guitar.

I am also a member of the [Swarthmore Varsity Men's Soccer Team](https://swarthmoreathletics.com/sports/mens-soccer) and the Swarthmore chapter of [Sigma Xi](https://www.swarthmore.edu/sigma-xi). I am currently researching numerical methods and kinetic models under Swarthmore Mathematics professor [Dr. Joseph Nakao](https://jhknakao.github.io/).
