This project was developed in collaboration with Swarthmore students Paolo Bosques-Paulet and Joost Almekinders as a practice submission for the Mathematical Competition in Modeling (MCM). We chose to submit a mock paper in response to the 2022 MCM Problem A found on the [MCM website](https://www.contest.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2022/problems/). This project was completed in preparation for the January 2026 MCM, in which our team will be participating.
